## Inventorius - WIP
[Inventorius][inventorius] is a free and open-source inventory tracking tool!

**Why**: Ok, we need an inventory-tracking tool in order to keep records of all the equipment in-house. *But* other than that, we want to learn more about web-app development and how it's done with [Ruby on Rails][ror].


## Installing
It's advisable to [Install RVM][rvm-install] (or rbenv) for isolated environments.

1. ``git clone https://github.com/fossaegean/inventorius.git``
2. ``$ cd inventorius``
3. ``bundle`` this will install all dependencies.
4. ``rails s``


## Contributing
If you are new to git & github, then [try git online][try-git] and maybe take a look at [github-cheatsheet][github-cheatsheet] - an [awesome][awesome] list.
You can find help regarding Pull Requests [here][pr-help-1] and [here][pr-help-2]

2. Clone your fork (ex. ``$ git clone https://github.com/username/inventorius.git``)
3. run ``$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/atzorvas/inventorius.git``
4. Develop your idea in a new branch ``$ git checkout -b feature/ideaname``
 1. Commit frequently (you can include [emojis][emojis]!)
 2. Don't do irrelevant changes/commits to this branch, so develop each idea/fix in a different branch
5. Push your branch to your forked repo with ``$ git push -u origin feature/ideaname``
